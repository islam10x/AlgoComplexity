# Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the performance of different sorting algorithms, including:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Python's Built-in ****\`\`**** (Timsort)**

The goal is to compare execution times and understand the efficiency of each algorithm for different dataset sizes.

## Execution Time Comparison

### Small Dataset (50 elements):

‚úÖ Bubble Sort took **0.001000** seconds.\
‚úÖ Selection Sort took **0.000000** seconds.

### Large Dataset (10,000 elements):

‚ö†Ô∏è Bubble Sort took **5.852864** seconds.\
‚úÖ Selection Sort took **2.510549** seconds.\
üöÄ Python Built-in Sort took **0.002001** seconds.

## Key Observations

- **Selection Sort** performs slightly better than **Bubble Sort** but is still inefficient for large datasets.
- \*\*Python's Built-in \*\*\`\` (Timsort) is significantly faster than both, making it the preferred choice for large-scale sorting.

## Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm                 | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Worst) |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Bubble Sort               | O(n)                   | O(n¬≤)                   |
| Selection Sort            | O(n¬≤)                  | O(n¬≤)                   |
| Python `sort()` (Timsort) | O(n log n)             | O(n log n)              |

## Real-World Implications

Using inefficient sorting methods can lead to:

- **Longer processing times** in large datasets.
- **Higher computational costs** due to increased CPU usage.
- **Poor user experience** in applications requiring real-time sorting.
- **Scalability issues** as data size grows.

## Conclusion

For practical applications, **Timsort (Python's ****\`\`****)** should be used due to its superior efficiency. Algorithms like **Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or Radix Sort** also offer better performance compared to Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.
